            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Then (I ≈øay) he employeth the great forces of the heauens,

               <!-- PDF PAGE 58 -->and the Elements, thereby to heale the vlcer of their vices, that wallow and take plea≈øure in ≈øinne, as a Sow delighteth to wallow in the mire.</p>
            <p>Which plainely appeareth by the deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accident happened of late in the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> where the force and furie of fire ≈øtrucke ≈øuch an a≈øtoni≈øhment in all the inhabitants, that they thought the Towne, like a ≈øecond <hi>Sodome,</hi> would ≈øuddenly haue beene con≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to a≈øhes, by the impetuous flames of fire that threatned them; and yet could not truely know the truth how it began: For it is ≈øo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer≈øly reported, that men cannot a≈ø≈øuredly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare any truth thereof: And it is prohibited by a Decree made in Court of Parliament, in any ≈øort to ≈øpeake thereof, to ≈øhunne and auoid the tumult and commotion of the people. But ≈øo it is, that vpon Saturday the 23. of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, about one of the clocke after midnight, the fire began in ≈øuch manner to flame out vpon the Merchants Bridge, that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof were ≈øurprized ≈øleeping in their beds, before they heard or perceiued it: for the fire (which met with nothing el≈øe but that which was combu≈øtible) increa≈øed with ≈øuch
<pb facs="tcp:2725:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 58 -->impetuo≈øitie, that in a ≈øhort time, all the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes that ≈øtood vpon the ≈øaid Bridge on both ≈øides, were on fire, by meanes of certaine beames that lay cro≈ø≈øe ouer one to another.</p>
            <p>The Change Bridge did no le≈ø≈øe feele the force and vigour which the ≈øaid fire vomited out, by meanes of the flames i≈ø≈øuing from the ≈øame: for that de≈øcending downe to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations thereof, in the end it burnt and ca≈øt it into the water, with all the hou≈øes ≈øtanding thereon, together with the great riches of the inhabitants, that by no meanes could ≈øaue any thing thereof, by rea≈øon of the ≈ømoake and heate, that hurt and choked diuers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ≈øome men that were burnt, fell down with the beames and peeces of wood all bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the riuer.</p>
            <p>You may iudge how many children and poore innocent ≈øoules were buried in that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piteous fire, for that their fathers and mothers had worke enough to doe, to ≈øaue them≈øelues. Many women newly brought in bed, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were ≈øicke in their beds, payd that debt to nature, which all of vs one day mu≈øt doe, neither hauing that force nor dexteritie ≈øufficient to ≈øaue them≈øelues. It was mo≈øt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
<pb facs="tcp:2725:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 59 -->to heare the wofull cries and ≈øigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, not onely of tho≈øe that were afflicted, but al≈øo of the ≈øpectators of that mi≈øerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident: The men in great feare ≈øaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues from that vnexpected deluge, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner halfe dead, blaming the heauens for their di≈øa≈øter, and not knowing how to bee reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for their lo≈ø≈øe, tooke reuenge vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues; and men were as much troubled to comfort them, as to ≈øaue the re≈øt of tho≈øe that were within their hou≈øes. Women in extreme di≈øcomfort, their haire hanging about their heades, and in a manner naked, beholding that horrible ≈øpectacle, bathing their faces with teares, and ca≈øting a thou≈øand ≈øighes vp into the ayre, ≈øwouned, and in a manner fell into de≈øpaire. Diuers ≈øeruants, both maides and men, as well as their ma≈øters and mi≈øtre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, induring and feeling the rigor of that mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, ≈øtood in the like manner as others did, ready to pay their debt to cruell de≈øtiny.</p>
            <p>The fire ≈øtill waxing greater and greater, mounted vp into the ayre with mighty flames, and ca≈øt ≈øuch and ≈øo great a light ouer all the Citie, that tho≈øe which knew nothing of that vnfortunate mi≈øchance, being awaked
<pb facs="tcp:2725:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 59 -->by the popular rumour, were in a maze, to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine from whence that light ≈øhould come, not knowing the cau≈øe; but as others did, in great feare ranne vnto the place.</p>
            <p>The Bels in diuers Churches began to ring, the noy≈øe whereof a≈øtoni≈øhing diuers Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the ≈øayd Towne, cau≈øed them to arme them≈øelues: at which time <hi>Paris</hi> began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a great tumult. When the Duke <hi>de Monba≈øon,</hi> Gouernour of the City, hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence thereof, came vnto the place with his Company of ≈øouldiers, the Watch, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others; all in Armes, placing a Court of guard at both ends of the Bridges, and other places. From thence he went to po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe the ≈øtronge≈øt and mo≈øt eminent places, as the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtille,</hi> the Kings Court called the <hi>Louure,</hi> the Towne hou≈øe, and diuers places of note; which done, he cau≈øed fires to be made tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout all the Citie, and Lanternes to bee hung out of euery window, in ≈øo great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, that it was as light as at noone-day: and cau≈øed foure Culuerins to be brought to both the ends of the ≈øaid Bridges: and to conclude, v≈øed ≈øuch diligence in that imminent danger, ≈øtill keeping good watch, doubting ≈øome
<pb facs="tcp:2725:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 60 -->trea≈øon, that he is perpetually to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, while he was thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently bu≈øied about that publike care, ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary in ≈øuch an extremitie: The fire, that like a tempe≈øt, deuoured and ≈øpoyled all that it tooke hold on, was not content with that whereon it had fir≈øt ≈øeized, but hauing ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the greedie de≈øire thereof, and brought all the hou≈øes and dwelling places vpon the ≈øayd two Bridges, into vtter ruine and de≈øola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and layd them in the valley of mi≈øerie, encrea≈øed more and more, and carried her flames into the Galue place; and if it had not beene for ≈øome artificiall trenches, and mens helpe, who in great numbers ranne thither, the great Ca≈øtle, and the gate of <hi>Paris,</hi> was in danger to haue felt the furie thereof. On the other ≈øide, in the extremitie of the raging flames, at the other end of the Bridges afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid, the fire was no le≈ø≈øe furious: for hauing ≈øeized vpon all the hou≈øes and ≈øhops neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as farre as before the Pallace, it tooke hold on the Dyall, and beganne to melt the Lead that couered it, vntill a great number of nimble and couragious men, ran thither, and
<pb facs="tcp:2725:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 60 -->employed all their forces and indu≈øtries, to ≈øaue that admirable worke.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Monba≈øon,</hi> while euery man was bu≈øied about that pitifull and mo≈øt lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table bu≈øines, on Sunday in the morning, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed commandement to bee made by ≈øound of Trumpet, that all the Citizens ≈øhould fill and ≈øet diuers tubs full of water at all the corners of the ≈øtreetes. And it is an incredible thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, how great a number of people from all places ranne vnto that place, to ≈øatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues with the ≈øight of that horrible fire, which filled their eyes with teares, and their bre≈øts with ≈øighes.</p>
            <p>This (friendly Reader) in briefe is the true relation that I can make vnto thee, to let thee know and vnder≈øtand this lamentable action: from whence the ≈øame proceeded no man knowes. Neuerthele≈ø≈øe, the Court, by a Decree made the 25. day of Octob. hath commanded all Iudges and Officers to make an exact enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of tho≈øe, that wickedly haue committed that di≈øorder; and that the knowledge thereof being had, ≈øo good Iu≈øtice may be v≈øed therein, that ≈øuch as they may take example thereby.</p>
